                    <p>Nguyễn Du (阮攸; 3 January 1766 - 16 September 1820), pen names Tố Như (素如) and Thanh Hiên (清軒), is
                        a celebrated Vietnamese poet. He is most known for writing the epic poem The Tale of Kiều.</p>
                    <p>&emsp;Nguyễn Du was born in a great wealthy family in 1765 in Bích Câu, Thăng Long. His father's
                        name
                        is Nguyễn Nghiễm, who was born in Tiên Điền village, Nghi Xuân, Hà Tĩnh, Vietnam. He was the
                        seventh child of Nguyễn Nghiễm, a former prime minister under the Lê dynasty. By the age of 10,
                        Nguyễn lost his father, he also lost his mother at age 13, so for most of his teen years he
                        lived with his brother Nguyễn Khản or with his brother-in-law Đoàn Nguyễn Tuấn.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>&emsp;At the age of 19 (some sources say 17), Nguyễn passed the provincial examination and
                        received
                        the title of "tú tài" (Bachelor's degree), which made him (very roughly) the equivalent of a
                        high school graduate. However, in Nguyễn Du's time this was a far more difficult credential to
                        obtain both because few people were affluent enough to devote themselves to study and because of
                        exacting standards applied.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>&emsp;Nguyễn's mother was his father's third wife, noted for her ability at singing and composing
                        poetry. In fact, she made her living by singing, which at that time was considered a
                        disreputable occupation. It is said that Nguyễn may have inherited a part of his talents from
                        his mother. He loved listening to traditional songs; and there was a rumor that, when he was 18,
                        he himself eloped with a songstress.</p>
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>&emsp;After passing the provincial exam, he was appointed to the position of a military advisor
                        in the
                        Royal (Trịnh) army. After the Trịnh lords were defeated in 1786 by Nguyễn Huệ (the second
                        youngest, most able and popular of the three Tây Sơn brothers), Nguyễn Du refused to serve in
                        the Tây Sơn administration. He was arrested and held for some time before moving back to his
                        native village in the north of the country.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>&emsp;When Nguyễn Ánh defeated the Tây Sơn and took control over all of Vietnam in 1802, Nguyễn
                        Du
                        agreed to serve in his administration (many mandarins from the north refused to do this as it
                        was widely felt that a mandarin should only serve one dynasty). At first he was given his old
                        post of military advisor but after a decade he was promoted to ambassador to China (1813). While
                        in China, he discovered and translated the Ming dynasty era tale that would become the basis for
                        the Tale of Kieu. He was later appointed to two more diplomatic missions to Peking, but before
                        he could depart for the last one, he died of a long illness for which he refused treatment.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>&emsp;Nguyễn's father had been a minister under the Lê dynasty, and his family had benefited
                        greatly
                        under their rule. For most of his life, Nguyễn Du was haunted by what he felt was his own
                        betrayal of the rightful rulers of Vietnam, which occurred when he accepted a post under the
                        Nguyễn's.</p>
